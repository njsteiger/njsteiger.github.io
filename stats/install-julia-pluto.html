    <p>Below are two sets of instructions for installing Julia and Pluto, one is a video recording and the other is written out in text with accompanying figures.</p>

<h2 id="text">Text and Pictures Version</h2>    
-->
    
<h3>Step 1: Install Julia</h3>    
    
<p>
Go to <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads">https://julialang.org/downloads</a> and download the current stable release of Julia, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc). Then run the installation as you normally would do for any other software program/application.
</p>
 
<h3>Step 2: Run Julia</h3>    
    
<p>After installing, make sure that you can run Julia. On some systems, this means searching for the ‘Julia X.X.X’ program installed on your computer (where X.X.X are numbers that refer to the current version of Julia that you downloaded); in others, it means running the command ‘julia’ in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute 1 + 1:</p>

<img src="img/launch-julia.png" alt="Run Julia" />
</figure>

<h3>Step 3: Install Pluto</h3>    
    
<p>Next we will install Pluto, the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia programming environment designed for interactivity and quick experiments.</p>

<p>Open the Julia REPL. This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type Julia commands, and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result.</p>

<p>To install Pluto, we want to run a package manager command. To switch from Julia mode to Pkg mode, type ] (closing square bracket) at the julia> prompt. It will look like the image below, where the Julia mode switches into the Pkg mode.
</p>
    
<figure>
    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/>
<img src="img/launch-julia-package.jpg" alt="Run Julia Package" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
The line turns another color and the prompt changes to pkg>, telling you that you are now in package manager mode. This mode allows you to do operations on packages (also called libraries).

To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to add (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet: ‘add Pluto’. You should only need to do this once for each installation of Julia:
</p>

<figure>
    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/>
<img src="img/add-pluto.jpg" alt="Add Pluto" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
This might take a couple of minutes to finish installing. Once this has finished, you will then exit out of the package manager by pressing the Delete key. This will bring you back to the REPL. At this point you will exit out of Julia by typing the command ‘exit()’ and pressing enter.
</p>

    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/>
<img src="img/exit-julia.jpg" alt="Exit Julia" />
</figure>    
    
<p>Now both Julia and Pluto are installed!</p>    
    
<h2 id="Running">Running Julia + Pluto and Opening a Notebook</h2>    

<p>Repeat the following steps anytime that you need to run Pluto and work on a notebook.</p> 
    
<h3>Step 1: Start Pluto</h3>   
    
<p>Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup by either running the command ‘julia’ in a terminal or by finding and starting the Julia application/program. Once Julia has started, in the REPL, type: ‘import Pluto; Pluto.run()’. (Note that you don’t have to remember this command because Julia will remember your command history, just press the UP arrow key button and old commands, such as starting Pluto, will appear.)</p>    
    
<figure>
    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/>
<img src="img/start-julia-and-pluto.jpg" alt="Runing Pluto" />
</figure> 
    
<p>This will open a browswer window located at http://localhost:1234/ followed by a unique identifying number after this that is generated randomly every time that you run Pluto. It should look something like the following:</p>
    
<figure>
    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">If you’re curious about what a Pluto notebook looks like, have a look at the Featured Notebooks. These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAF8DjrQSSk" >JuliaCon presentation</a>.</span>
<img src="img/pluto-browser.png" alt="Runing Pluto 2" />
</figure>    
    
<p>If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again.</p>
    
<h3>Step 2: Opening a Notebook From the Internet</h3>
    
<p>From the main menu, you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our assignments will always be based on a template notebook available from this <a href="https://github.com/njsteiger/njsteiger.github.io/tree/main/stats/assignments" >GitHub repository</a> and there will be links to each assignment on the Moodle class page. To start from an assignment template notebook, just paste the URL into the ‘Open a notebook’ box and press the Open button (or ENTER key).</p>

<p>
For example, Assignment 1 is available <a href="https://github.com/njsteiger/njsteiger.github.io/blob/main/stats/assignments/assign-01.jl" >here</a>. Go to this page and copy the URL and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. You should now get something like the following in your browser:</p>
    
<figure>
    <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/>
<img src="img/assignment1-screenshot.jpg" alt="Assignment 1" />
</figure> 
    
    
<p>When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off.</p>
    
<h3>Step 3: Saving a Notebook</h3>
    
<p>Always make sure that you save your notebook somewhere on your computer since what you have downloaded is only the assignment template. At the top of the page you will have the option to save the notebook at a specific location on your computer. Click on this box and navigate to a folder on your computer where you want to save the assignment and save it there.</p>
