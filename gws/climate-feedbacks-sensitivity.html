<h2 id="forcing-response">Forcing and Response</h2>    
    
<p>
We’ve learned that the climate system can be forced by external processes. For example, the Earth’s temperature is partly determined by the Sun’s energy output. We call this a ‘radiative forcing’. Changes in forcing are due to changes in external, but not internal, processes. Internal processes are those that occur within the climate system itself. Examples include weather systems, ocean circulations, and land-surface processes. External processes are unaffected by the state of the system. As an example, the flow of energy from the Sun is unaffected by the state of the Earth’s climate system. Note that even though human affairs are strongly affected by climate, human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, are considered ‘external’ to the climate system.
</p>
    
<p>
Consider a simple example. Suppose that the brightness of the Sun were to change. This would produce a response or change in the Earth’s temperature. We can capture this idea mathematically<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The following derivation follows that in: Roe, ‘Feedbacks, Timescales, and Seeing Red’ (2009). Please see this source for further details.</span> by writing that for a given change in radiative forcing, \(\Delta R\), there will be a change in temperature, \(\Delta T\), such that 
    
\[\lambda \Delta R = \Delta T \; , \tag{1}\]

where \(\lambda\) is called the climate sensitivity parameter, which determines how strong the temperature response is for a given climate system.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It turns out that Earth now, Earth during an ice age, Mars now, Venus now, etc., all have different climate sensitivity parameters.</span> This equation is a ‘linear’ equation and assumes that the change in forcing, \(\Delta R\), is relatively small (the current energy imbalance due to global warming is about 1 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\), compared to the total energy flux of about 340 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)). 
</p>    
    
<p>
This equation works well for a planet with no atmosphere. But what if by changing the solar radiative forcing, the Earth’s atmosphere were to respond in some way? What if the atmosphere could counteract or damp the forcing? If the Sun were to put out more energy, perhaps the Earth’s atmosphere could change somehow to cool itself down so that it wouldn’t warm as much as it might otherwise do without an atmosphere? Alternatively, perhaps it’s possible for Earth’s atmosphere to amplify the increase in solar radiation, making Earth even hotter than it might otherwise be? These effects are called ‘feedbacks’ and they occur widely in many technical fields and even in daily life. ‘Positive feedbacks’ amplify and ‘negative feedbacks’ counteract or damp.
</p>
    
<p>
A familiar example of a positive feedback is the unpleasant squeal produced by a sound system that includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, and a speaker. A sound picked up by the microphone is amplified and played through the speaker. If the speaker is too close to the microphone or if the gain of the amplifier is turned up too high, the sound produced by the speaker is picked up by the microphone and further amplified, leading to the familiar screeching of audio feedback. Small perturbations are amplified; this is characteristic of a positive feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
A familiar example of a negative feedback is temperature control by a thermostat that is coupled to a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. After you set a target temperature, the thermostat detects temperature excursions from the target value and commands the system to fight against those excursions by warming when the room is too cool and cooling when the room is too warm. Small perturbations are damped; this is characteristic of a negative feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
How then can we add feedbacks into our mathematical description of climate forcing, Eq. (1)? Adding in a feedback means that some part of the temperature response gets added back into the radiative forcing; some of the temperature ‘output’ is fed back into the radiative ‘input’, so that it can increase or reduce the initial forcing. The simplest representation of this small radiative addition is linear, \(c_1 \Delta T\), where \(c_1\) is the proportion of the temperature response that affects the radiative forcing. So we can modify Eq. (1) so that we have 

\[\Delta T = \lambda (\Delta R + c_1 \Delta T )\; ,\]

and solving for \(\Delta T\) we have 

\[\Delta T = \frac{\lambda \Delta R}{1-c_1\lambda} \; .\]

This equation is often simplified slightly by introducing the ‘feedback factor’ \(f=c_1\lambda\), so that

\[\Delta T = \frac{\lambda \Delta R}{1-f} \; . \tag{2}\]

</p>
   
<p>
Mathematically, a negative feedback means that \(f\) is negative, while a positive feedback means that \(f\) is positive. If there are no feedbacks, and thus \(f=0\), then we get back our initial Eq. (1). If we have several different feedbacks, these can just be added into \(f\) because they too are just additions or subtractions to the radiative change (e.g., for three feedbacks \(f=f_1+f_2+f_3\)).
</p>
    
<p>
It turns out that the climate system has several important feedbacks that modify the radiative change due to increasing greenhouse gases. Let’s look at each of these in turn.

<h2 id="albedo-feedback">The Snow and Ice Albedo Feedback</h2> 
    

<p>
We’ll begin with what is called the snow and ice albedo feedback, or sometimes simply the ‘albedo feedback’. This climate feedback is not a big feedback, but it’s fairly simple, so we’ll use it as an introductory example.
</p>
    
<p>
In a warmer climate, snow and ice cover are expected to decrease globally. The dependence of snow and ice cover on surface temperature is the first essential part of the snow and ice albedo feedback. A second essential part is that snow and ice absorb less solar radiation than the darker surfaces that they cover up. When dark soil or rock emerges from beneath white snow or a retreating glacier, or when the dark ocean emerges from beneath the white, sometimes snow-covered sea ice, more solar radiation is absorbed by the newly darkened surface. We therefore expect the albedo to decrease as the surface temperature increases. The reduced albedo leads to an increase in the absorption of solar radiation. The added solar energy causes warming, which, in turn, can cause even more melting. This is a ‘positive feedback loop’, as depicted below.
</p>

</figure>    
    
<p>
The positive snow and ice albedo feedback can amplify a cooling, as well as a warming. If the climate cools, the resulting increased snow and ice cover reflects more sunlight back to space, and the cooling is amplified. <i>Note that both positive and negative feedbacks can cause either warming or cooling; their role is to amplify or damp a given temperature change.</i>

<h2 id="watervapor-feedback">The Water Vapor Feedback</h2> 
      
    
<p>
The positive water vapor feedback is the most important atmospheric feedback in the climate system. Its existence was recognized over a century ago by Svante Arrhenius in the 1890s, though it took until the late 1960s and the first computer-based climate modeling work to begin to understand its full significance. 
</p>
    
<p>
The water vapor feedback is fundamentally based on the principle that the atmosphere can hold exponentially more water vapor at higher temperatures. This is illustrated below, which is a plot of the ‘saturation vapor pressure of water’ as a function of temperature; equivalently, this figure shows how 100% relative humidity (or how air becomes completely saturated with water) changes with temperature.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Saturation vapor pressure, \(e^*\), as a function of temperature and in units of hectopascals or hPa. Air in the real world can have less or sometimes slightly more water vapor than this, but if the water vapor concentration gets too much higher than this curve, the water will condense out into water droplets or snow. Randall, ‘Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate’, (2011).</span>
<img src="img/saturation-vapor-pressure.png" alt="Water vapor" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
At the Earth’s globally averaged surface temperature of 288 K, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% for a 1 K warming. Therefore the water vapor content of the atmosphere will increase by about 7% per K as the climate warms. Because water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, that is, it strongly absorbs and emits infrared radiation, an increase in the atmospheric water vapor content causes an increase in the downwelling infrared radiation at the Earth’s surface. This further increases the warming and thus the initial perturbation is amplified. So the water vapor feedback is a positive feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
Surface evaporation can moisten a deep layer of air only if a mechanism exists to carry water vapor upward away from the surface. Turbulence of air currents near the surface helps, but it isn’t enough to bring water vapor higher than 1 km. Further lifting of moisture is necessary if the total moisture content of the atmosphere is to increase by very much. The most important mechanism for such further lifting is cumulus convection (see below). For this reason, convective clouds play an essential role in the water vapor feedback.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">A picture of small and large cumulus clouds, formed by convection or rapidly rising moist air. The air around the cloud towers is slowly sinking. Some of the larger towers have flat cloud layers near their tops. These are regions where the air has stopped rising and is flowing out to the sides. Randall, ‘Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate’, (2011).</span>
<img src="img/cumulus-clouds-airplane.png" alt="Cumulus clouds" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
The mass of water vapor in the atmosphere exceeds the mass of carbon dioxide by about a factor of 4, and water vapor contributes more to the downward infrared at the Earth’s surface than \(\text{CO}_2\) does. Despite these facts, \(\text{CO}_2\) plays a controlling role in the greenhouse effect, while water vapor plays a subservient role. The reason is that water vapor is condensible and can be removed from the atmosphere by precipitation, whereas \(\text{CO}_2\) does not condense under conditions found in the Earth’s atmosphere and can only be removed by rock weathering via the Urey reaction.</p>
    
<p>
Lacis et al. (2010) illustrated the primary role of \(\text{CO}_2\) through a clever and simple experiment with a climate model. When run with realistic present-day \(\text{CO}_2\) concentrations, the model produces a realistic simulation of today’s observed climate. In the experiment, Lacis and colleagues removed all of the \(\text{CO}_2\) (and other noncondensing greenhouse gases) from the atmosphere. The results were spectacular. As we can see in the figure below, the surface temperature began to fall immediately as a direct result of the absence of \(\text{CO}_2\). This led to a reduction in the water vapor content of the atmosphere and additional cooling through the water vapor feedback. The positive snow and ice albedo feedback also reinforced the cooling (albedo increases over time). Within 10 simulated years, the Earth became almost completely covered in ice and had an atmosphere with very little water vapor.
</p>

The initial conditions are for a preindustrial atmosphere. Surface temperature and top-of-the-atmosphere net radiation use the left-hand scale.

</figure>    
    
<p>
Suppose that we ran a ‘mirror-image’ experiment, in which the \(\text{CO}_2\) concentration was realistic but the water vapor content of the atmosphere was set to zero at the beginning of the simulation. Evaporation from the oceans would restore a realistic water vapor distribution within a few simulated weeks, and the simulated climate would stay close to what we observe today.
</p>
    
<p>
An extreme version of the water vapor feedback, called a ‘runaway greenhouse’, likely occurred on Venus.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ingersoll, ‘Planetary Climates’, (2013).</span> Venus is similarly sized compared to the Earth and very likely began its existence with a similar amount of water as the Earth. But Venus’ curse was that it was too close to the Sun and receives almost twice as much solar radiation as Earth (2601 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) compared to Earth’s 1361 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)). The extra solar radiation evaporated Venus’ oceans into its atmosphere, giving it a hot, moist, and dense water atmosphere. This would have increased the surface temperature so much that no life could survive. Water vapor that was high in Venus’ atmosphere could also be blown apart by high energy photons, allowing the hydrogen to escape to space. The oxygen then combined with other molecules at the surface and in the atmosphere so that eventually the hot Venus also lost its water. 
</p>
    
<p>
Current estimates suggest that it is unlikely that Earth will experience a runaway greenhouse due human activities (Ord probability here?). But if we manage to cause mass extinction due to global warming, it will be through the water vapor feedback.

<h2 id="cloud-feedbacks">Cloud Feedbacks</h2> 
  
<p>
Cloud feedbacks are infamous. Their potential importance has been recognized at least since the 1970s. For decades, they have been highlighted as a major source of uncertainty in predictions of future climate change. Why is the problem taking so long to solve?
</p>
    
<p>
Although cloud processes are among the most important for climate, they are also among the most difficult to understand and predict. Clouds usually form in rising air, which expands and cools until condensation occurs. Cloud processes can be grouped into five categories, all of which are important for the climate system:
</p>
    
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Cloud microphysical processes, involving cloud drops, ice crystals, and aerosols, with scales on the order of microns</li>
  <li>Cloud dynamical processes associated with the motion of the air in cumulus clouds, with scales on the order of a few kilometers</li>
  <li>Cloud radiative processes, involving the flows of both solar and terrestrial radiation through the cloud field</li>
  <li>Cloud turbulence processes, which include near-surface turbulence, the entrainment of environmental air into the clouds, and the formation of small clouds</li>
  <li>Cloud chemical processes, which, among other things, are important for the annual formation of the ozone hole through the destruction of ozone in polar stratospheric clouds</li>
</ol>
</p>    
    
<p>
These various processes interact with each other on space scales of a few kilometers and time scales of a few minutes, and they also jointly interact with larger-scale weather systems, up to the size of the Earth itself. Clouds also couple climate processes together. For example, they cast shadows on the land and ocean, which tend to reduce the surface temperature and evaporation rate.
</p>
    
<p>
Each cloud process has the potential to be a feedback as the climate state evolves due to externally forced variability. As a result, there are many different kinds of cloud feedbacks. Broadly speaking, they occur through changes in cloud amount, cloud top height, and cloud optical properties. For a given climate change, there can be many different changes in the geographical patterns and seasonal distributions of both high and low clouds. The net cloud feedback results from the combined effect of these various changes.
</p>
    
<p>
The two primary cloud feedbacks are discussed below, though several others exist.
</p>
    
<h3 id="cloud-feedbacks">Low-Cloud Feedbacks</h3>       
      
<p>
Thick clouds behave like blackbodies. Low clouds emit at relatively warm temperatures, not very different from the temperature of the Earth’s surface. As a result, an increase in low cloud amount has relatively little effect on Earth’s outgoing infrared radiation.
</p>
    
<p>
On the other hand, low clouds can be very bright (as seen from above), reflecting back to space up to half of the solar radiation that hits them. As a result, they tend to cool the Earth. In a future climate warmed by increasing greenhouse gases, an increase in low cloud amount would increase the cooling, and so could reduce the warming. On the other hand, a decrease in low-cloud amount would increase the warming.
</p>
    
<p>
Low cloud amount tends to be greater when the sea-surface temperature (SST) is cooler than the average SST at that latitude. For example, the SST west of San Diego, California is cooler than the average SST at 32°N, and low clouds are very abundant there, especially in the summer. Over cold water, low clouds typically take the form of a uniform overcast sky. When the water is warmer, the low clouds change their type, to shallow cumulus clouds with smaller cloud fractions, which amplifies the warming. Observational evidence (e.g., Norris and Leovy, 1994; Clement et al. 2009) supports a positive feedback associated with low clouds.
</p>
    
<h3 id="cloud-feedbacks">High-Cloud Feedbacks</h3>       
      
<p>
CLEARER EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION? MAYBE ADD A FIGURE FROM ARCHER?
High, cold cirrus clouds are often somewhat transparent, so they don’t reflect as much solar radiation as typical low-level clouds, but they do efficiently absorb the infrared radiation coming from the Earth’s surface; the presence of cirrus clouds leads to a radiative warming near the base of the clouds. The high clouds emit to space, but only weakly because of their very cold temperatures. They therefore tend to warm the Earth as a whole. An increase in high cloud amount will tend to enhance greenhouse warming, while a decrease will tend to reduce it.
</p>
    
<p>
Even if the high-cloud amount remains the same, the high clouds can produce a positive feedback as the surface warms up, because they will absorb the increased infrared coming from the warmer surface. Tropical cumulus clouds often stop about 15 km above the Earth’s surface, where the temperature is about 200 K. The tall tropical cumuli produce broad regions of optically thick cirrus and anvil clouds near their tops, which therefore emit infrared at a temperature of about 200 K. If this stays the same under global warming, then the outgoing infrared radiation will not change even when the climate changes. The outgoing radiation will therefore be insensitive to the surface temperature. The Earth will not be able to increase its infrared emission to space as the surface temperature increases. The bulk emissivity will therefore decrease as the Earth warms. This is a positive cloud feedback.
