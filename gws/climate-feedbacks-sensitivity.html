<h2 id="forcing-response">Forcing and Response</h2>    
    
<p>
We’ve learned that the climate system can be forced by external processes. For example, the Earth’s temperature is partly determined by the Sun’s energy output. We call this a ‘radiative forcing’. Changes in forcing are due to changes in external, but not internal, processes. Internal processes are those that occur within the climate system itself. Examples include weather systems, ocean circulations, and land-surface processes. External processes are unaffected by the state of the system. As an example, the flow of energy from the Sun is unaffected by the state of the Earth’s climate system. Note that even though human affairs are strongly affected by climate, human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, are considered ‘external’ to the climate system.
</p>
    
<p>
Consider a simple example. Suppose that the brightness of the Sun were to change. This would produce a response or change in the Earth’s temperature. We can capture this idea mathematically<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The following derivation follows that in: Roe, <i>Feedbacks, Timescales, and Seeing Red</i>, (2009). Please see this source for further details.</span> by writing that for a given change in radiative forcing, \(\Delta R\), there will be a change in temperature, \(\Delta T\), such that 
    
\[\lambda \Delta R = \Delta T \; , \tag{1}\]

where \(\lambda\) is called the climate sensitivity parameter, which determines how strong the temperature response is for a given climate system. This equation is a ‘linear’ equation and assumes that the change in forcing, \(\Delta R\), is relatively small (the current energy imbalance due to global warming is about 1 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\), compared to the total energy flux of about 340 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\)).
</p>    

<p>
The most fundamental planetary energy balance we can use in calculating the climate sensitivity parameter, \(\lambda\), is the Stefan-Boltzman law, \(\mathcal{F}=\sigma T^4\), that we learned about in Chapter 2. We can write Eq. (1) in differential form, plug in the Stefan-Boltzman law, and take its derivative to get the following,
    
\[\lambda = \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta R } = \frac{dT}{dF} = \frac{1}{dF/dT} = \frac{1}{4\sigma T^3} \; .\]

In Chapter 2 we calculated that the Earth without an atmosphere would be 253.7 K, so this implies that \(\lambda = 0.27\,\text{m}^2\text{K}/\text{W}\) for the most fundamental energy balance model of Earth. What does this value of \(\lambda\) mean? It means that for every 1 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) of excess radiative forcing, our modeled planet will increase its temperature by 0.27 K. We will explore this further at the end of this chapter.
</p>    
    
<p>
So Eq. (1) works for a planet with no atmosphere. But what if by changing the solar radiative forcing, the Earth’s atmosphere were to respond in some way? What if the atmosphere could counteract or damp the forcing? If the Sun were to put out more energy, perhaps the Earth’s atmosphere could change somehow to cool itself down so that it wouldn’t warm as much as it might otherwise do without an atmosphere? Alternatively, perhaps it’s possible for Earth’s atmosphere to amplify the increase in solar radiation, making Earth even hotter than it might otherwise be? These effects are called ‘feedbacks’ and they occur widely in many technical fields and even in daily life. ‘Positive feedbacks’ amplify and ‘negative feedbacks’ counteract or damp.
</p>
    
<p>
A familiar example of a positive feedback is the unpleasant squeal produced by a sound system that includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, and a speaker.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These examples are from: Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span> A sound picked up by the microphone is amplified and played through the speaker. If the speaker is too close to the microphone or if the gain of the amplifier is turned up too high, the sound produced by the speaker is picked up by the microphone and further amplified, leading to the familiar screeching of audio feedback. Small perturbations are amplified; this is characteristic of a positive feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
A familiar example of a negative feedback is temperature control by a thermostat that is coupled to a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. After you set a target temperature, the thermostat detects temperature excursions from the target value and commands the system to fight against those excursions by warming when the room is too cool and cooling when the room is too warm. Small perturbations are damped; this is characteristic of a negative feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
How then can we add feedbacks into our mathematical description of climate forcing, Eq. (1)? Adding in a feedback means that some part of the temperature response gets ‘fed back’ or added back into the radiative forcing; some of the temperature ‘output’ is fed back into the radiative ‘input’, so that it can increase or reduce the effect of the initial forcing. The simplest representation of this small radiative addition is linear, \(c_1 \Delta T\), where \(c_1\) is the proportion of the temperature response that affects the radiative forcing. So we can modify Eq. (1) so that we have 

\[\Delta T = \lambda (\Delta R + c_1 \Delta T )\; ,\]

and solving for \(\Delta T\) we have 

\[\Delta T = \frac{\lambda \Delta R}{1-c_1\lambda} \; .\]

This equation is often simplified slightly by introducing the ‘feedback factor’ \(f=c_1\lambda\), so that

\[\Delta T = \frac{\lambda \Delta R}{1-f} \; . \tag{2}\]

</p>
   
<p>
Mathematically, a negative feedback means that \(f\) is negative, while a positive feedback means that \(f\) is positive. If there are no feedbacks, and thus \(f=0\), then we get back our initial Eq. (1). If we have several different feedbacks, these can just be added into \(f\) because they too are just additions or subtractions to the radiative change (e.g., for three feedbacks \(f=f_1+f_2+f_3\)).
</p>
    
<p>
It turns out that the climate system has several important feedbacks that modify the radiative change due to increasing greenhouse gases. Let’s look at each of these in turn.

<h2 id="albedo-feedback">The Snow and Ice Albedo Feedback</h2> 
    

<p>
We’ll begin with what is called the snow and ice albedo feedback, or sometimes simply the ‘albedo feedback’. This climate feedback is not a big feedback, but it’s fairly simple, so we’ll use it as an introductory example.
</p>
    
<p>
In a warmer climate, snow and ice cover are expected to decrease globally. The dependence of snow and ice cover on surface temperature is the first essential part of the snow and ice albedo feedback. A second essential part is that snow and ice absorb less solar radiation than the darker surfaces that they cover up. When dark soil or rock emerges from beneath white snow or a retreating glacier, or when the dark ocean emerges from beneath the white, sometimes snow-covered sea ice, more solar radiation is absorbed by the newly darkened surface. We therefore expect the albedo to decrease as the surface temperature increases. The reduced albedo leads to an increase in the absorption of solar radiation. The added solar energy causes warming, which, in turn, can cause even more melting. This is a ‘positive feedback loop’, as depicted below.
</p>
    
<figure>

</figure>    
    
<p>
The positive snow and ice albedo feedback can amplify a cooling, as well as a warming. If the climate cools, the resulting increased snow and ice cover reflects more sunlight back to space, and the cooling is amplified. Note that both positive and negative feedbacks can cause either warming or cooling; their role is to amplify or damp a given temperature change.

<h2 id="watervapor-feedback">The Water Vapor Feedback</h2> 
      
    
<p>
The water vapor feedback is the most important atmospheric feedback in the climate system. Its existence was recognized over a century ago by Svante Arrhenius in the 1890s, though it took until the late 1960s and the first computer-based climate modeling work to begin to understand its full significance. 
</p>
    
<p>
The water vapor feedback is fundamentally based on the principle that the atmosphere can hold exponentially more water vapor at higher temperatures. This is illustrated below, which is a plot of the ‘saturation vapor pressure of water’ as a function of temperature; equivalently, this figure shows how 100% relative humidity (or how air becomes completely saturated with water) changes with temperature.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Saturation vapor pressure, \(e^*\), as a function of temperature and in units of hectopascals or hPa. Air in the real world can have less or sometimes slightly more water vapor than this, but if the water vapor concentration gets too much higher than this curve, the water will condense out into water droplets or snow. Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span>
<img src="img/saturation-vapor-pressure.png" alt="Water vapor" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
At the Earth’s globally averaged surface temperature of 288 K, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% for a 1 K warming. Therefore the water vapor content of the atmosphere will increase by about 7% per K as the climate warms.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span> Because water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, that is, it strongly absorbs and emits infrared radiation, an increase in the atmospheric water vapor content causes an increase in the downwelling infrared radiation at the Earth’s surface. This further increases the warming and thus the initial perturbation is amplified. So the water vapor feedback is a positive feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
Surface evaporation can moisten a deep layer of air only if a mechanism exists to carry water vapor upward away from the surface. Turbulence of air currents near the surface helps, but it isn’t enough to bring water vapor higher than about 1 km. Further lifting of moisture is necessary if the total moisture content of the atmosphere is to increase by very much. The most important mechanism for such further lifting is cumulus convection (see below).<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span> For this reason, convective clouds play an essential role in the water vapor feedback.
</p>

<img src="img/cumulus-clouds-airplane.png" alt="Cumulus clouds" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
The mass of water vapor in the atmosphere exceeds the mass of carbon dioxide by about a factor of 4, and water vapor contributes more to the downward infrared at the Earth’s surface than \(\text{CO}_2\) does. Despite this, \(\text{CO}_2\) controls the greenhouse effect while water vapor plays a subservient role. Why is that? It’s because water vapor is condensible and can be removed from the atmosphere by precipitation, whereas \(\text{CO}_2\) does not condense under conditions found in the Earth’s atmosphere and can only be removed on very long timescales by rock weathering via the Urey reaction.</p>
    
<p>
Lacis et al. (2010) illustrated the primary role of \(\text{CO}_2\) through a clever and simple experiment with a climate model. When run with realistic present-day \(\text{CO}_2\) concentrations, the model produces a realistic simulation of today’s observed climate. In the experiment, Lacis and colleagues removed all of the \(\text{CO}_2\) from the atmosphere. The results were spectacular. As we can see in the figure below, the surface temperature began to fall immediately as a direct result of the absence of \(\text{CO}_2\). This led to a reduction in the water vapor content of the atmosphere and additional cooling through the water vapor feedback. The positive snow and ice albedo feedback also reinforced the cooling (albedo increases over time). Within 10 simulated years, the Earth became almost completely covered in ice and had an atmosphere with very little water vapor.
</p>

</figure>    
    
<p>
Suppose that we ran a ‘mirror-image’ experiment, in which the \(\text{CO}_2\) concentration was realistic but the water vapor content of the atmosphere was set to zero at the beginning of the simulation. There would be a brief cooling but evaporation from the oceans would restore a realistic water vapor distribution within a few simulated weeks, and the simulated climate would stay close to what we observe today.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span>
</p>
    
<p>
An extreme version of the water vapor feedback, called a ‘runaway greenhouse’, likely occurred on Venus.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ingersoll, <i>Planetary Climates</i>, (2013).</span> Venus is similarly sized compared to the Earth and very likely began its existence with a similar amount of water as the Earth. But Venus’ curse was that it was too close to the Sun, receiving significantly more solar radiation than Earth (in its early existence it would have received about 1/3 more than what Earth currently receives<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Catling and Kasting, <i>Atmospheric Evolution on Inhabited and Lifeless Worlds</i>, (2017).</span>). The extra solar radiation evaporated Venus’ oceans into its atmosphere, giving it a hot, moist, and dense water atmosphere. This would have increased the surface temperature so much that no life could survive. Water vapor that was high in Venus’ atmosphere could also be blown apart by high energy photons, allowing the hydrogen to escape to space. The oxygen from the water vapor remnants would then combine with iron molecules at the surface so that eventually the hot Venus also lost its water. 
</p>
    
<p>
While global warming will result in many negative outcomes, a runaway greenhouse is the only known mechanism by which global warming, in its severest form, could directly cause a collapse of global civilization or the extinction of humanity.<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">For more discussion of the existential risk posed by global warming, in the context of all other known existential risks, see Ord, <i>The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</i>, (2020).</span> The best current estimate is that there is an approximately 1 in 1000 chance of the Earth crossing a point of no return in the next 100 years or so and eventually going into a runaway greenhouse state (or a practical equivalent known as a ‘moist greenhouse’ state where Earth is too hot to sustain life but not hot enough for the oceans to boil away into the atmosphere). Under this worst-case scenario, the climate system would need to be particularly sensitive to radiative forcing, humans would need to burn nearly all the available fossil fuels, and nearly all of the land carbon in peat deposits and ocean carbon in methane hydrates would need to be emitted by the warming Earth (recall Chapter 5). This 1 in 1000 chance is comparable to the estimated risk of global nuclear war in the next 100 years but more likely than the estimated risk of a supervolcano eruption (1 in 10,000) or a massive asteroid impact (1 in 1,000,000) occurring in the next 100 years. So in the unlikely event that we manage to bring about our own extinction due to global warming, it will be through the water vapor feedback.

<h2 id="lapserate-feedbacks">The Lapse-Rate Feedback</h2>       
      
<p>
Recall from Chapter 2 that the troposphere gets cooler with height. The rate that temperature decreases with altitude is called the atmospheric ‘lapse rate’. This can be described according to the equation, \(\Gamma = - \frac{dT}{dz} \), where \(T\) is the temperature and \(z\) the altitude or height. The negative sign convention gives a positive number for \(\Gamma\) in the troposphere. The global average lapse rate on Earth is about 6.5 K/km. 
</p>
    
<p>
As the atmosphere warms there are basically three different ways that the lapse rate could change in the troposphere, as shown in the figure below, which shows shifts relative to a typical tropical lapse rate (black line). There could be a uniform warming shift (blue line), the lower part of the troposphere could warm more than the upper part (purple line), or the upper part of the troposphere could warm more than the lower part (orange line).
</p>
    
<figure class="fullwidth">
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"></span>
<img src="img/lapse-rate-changes.png" alt="Lapse rate responses" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
If the warming is uniform through the troposphere, with a lapse rate that does not change, then there is no strong lapse-rate feedback. But if the lapse rate changes, then there will be some interesting effects. Infrared photons that are emitted nearer to the surface have a harder time escaping to space because they are more likely to be absorbed somewhere in the atmosphere as they try to travel out to space. So a preferential warming of the surface, as in the purple line, ends up trapping more photons near the surface, which leads to more surface warming—a positive feedback. But if there’s preferential warming in the upper troposphere, as in the orange line, photons have an easier time escaping to space, meaning that a warming would lead to more efficient cooling—a negative feedback. Using terms we learned in Chapter 3 we could say that preferential warming near the surface decreases the atmosphere’s emissivity while preferential warming near the top increases the atmosphere’s emissivity.
</p>
    
<p>
So under global warming, which of these occur? The answer is actually all three: different regions on Earth have different lapse rate responses. But on a global average, the lapse rate response in the tropics ends up being much stronger than anywhere else, leading to an average preferential warming with height (a decreased lapse-rate), and thus a negative feedback.
</p>
    
<p>
Why do the tropics have a preferential warming with height? The tropics have a lot of rising moist air or moist convection, much more than anywhere else on Earth. And when the air rises and cools, eventually water will begin to condense out of the gas phase and into the liquid phase, thus forming clouds. But the transition from gas to liquid releases energy, called ‘latent heat’. (Just the opposite process happens when you boil water: you have to add heat to transition the water from liquid to gas.) So the atmosphere gets an additional boost of energy as the moist air rises and condenses into clouds. In a warmer world, air will hold more water, so there will be more energy to release. This leads to preferential warming with height and thus the tropics have a negative lapse rate feedback.

<h2 id="cloud-feedbacks">Cloud Feedbacks</h2> 
  
<p>
Cloud feedbacks are infamous. Their potential importance has been recognized at least since the 1970s. For decades, they have been highlighted as a major source of uncertainty in predictions of future climate change. Why is the problem taking so long to solve?
</p>
    
<p>
Although cloud processes are among the most important for climate, they are also among the most difficult to understand and predict. Cloud processes can be grouped into five categories, all of which are important for the climate system:<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span>
</p>
    
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Cloud microphysical processes, involving cloud drops, ice crystals, and aerosols, with scales on the order of microns</li>
  <li>Cloud dynamical processes associated with the motion of the air in cumulus clouds, with scales on the order of a few kilometers</li>
  <li>Cloud radiative processes, involving the flows of both solar and terrestrial radiation through the cloud field</li>
  <li>Cloud turbulence processes, which include near-surface turbulence, the entrainment of environmental air into the clouds, and the formation of small clouds</li>
  <li>Cloud chemical processes, which, among other things, are important for the annual formation of the ozone hole through the destruction of ozone in polar stratospheric clouds</li>
</ol>
</p>    
    
<p>
In addition to multiple processes existing, these various processes interact with each other on space scales of a few kilometers and time scales of a few minutes, and they also jointly interact with larger-scale weather systems, up to the size of the Earth itself. Clouds also couple climate processes together. For example, they cast shadows on the land and ocean, which tend to reduce the surface temperature and evaporation rate.
</p>
    
<p>
Clouds are therefore difficult to understand and predict because they are complex: they have multiple processes, they interact on small and large scales, and they are coupled with many other non-cloud features of the climate system.   
</p>    
      
<p>
Each cloud process has the potential to be a feedback as the climate state evolves due to externally forced variability. As a result, there are many different kinds of cloud feedbacks. Broadly speaking, they occur through changes in cloud amount, cloud top height, and cloud optical properties.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Randall, <i>Atmosphere, Clouds, and Climate</i>, (2011).</span>
</p>
    
<h3 id="cloud-feedbacks">High-Cloud Feedbacks</h3>       
      
<p>
Most clouds behave like blackbodies because they are composed of liquid water droplets or ice crystals. We learned in Chapter 3 that water vapor can absorb radiation in continuum sections of the radiation distribution instead of in lines or bands like most other gases. It turns out that water droplets and ice crystals are even better blackbodies than gaseous water vapor. Clouds are therefore good at absorbing and emitting infrared radiation.
</p>

<p>      
High, cold cirrus clouds (see below) are often fairly transparent to visible light, so they don’t reflect much incoming solar radiation. But, because they are clouds, they do efficiently absorb and re-emit the infrared radiation coming from the Earth’s surface. So they do not change the incoming solar radiation but they do increase the downard infrared radiation; this means that cirrus clouds tend to warm the surface of Earth. 
</p>

</figure>      
    
<p>
Another type of cloud that reaches high into the atmosphere is large cumulus clouds (specifically called ‘cumulonimbus’); we saw examples of these large tower-like clouds in a figure above. In addition to the tall columns or towers of cloud these produce, we can see in the figure that they also make broad areas of cirrus clouds, making them look like anvils all together.
</p>
    
<p>      
A curious feature of tropical cumulus clouds is that they often stop about 15 km above the Earth’s surface, about the location of the tropopause in the tropics, where the temperature is about 200 K. The broad regions of thick clouds near their tops therefore emit infrared at a blackbody temperature of about 200 K. In global warming simulations tropical cumulus clouds tend to maintain approximately the same 200 K temperature at their tops. This means that the outgoing infrared radiation from these clouds can’t change. The outgoing radiation will therefore be insensitive to the surface temperature. The most important implication of this fact is that Earth’s tropical regions, which are often covered with cumulus and cirrus clouds, will not be able to efficiently increase their infrared emission to space from the cloud tops as the surface warms. If they can’t emit more radiation to space, that radiation will stay near the surface and lead to warming. A warming that leads to further warming is a positive feedback. Climate model simulations of global warming show a strong positive cloud feedback in the tropics associated with this mechanism.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Zelinka and Hartmann, <i>Why is longwave cloud feedback positive?</i>, (2010).</span>
</p>      
      
      
<h3 id="cloud-feedbacks">Low-Cloud Feedbacks</h3>       
      
<p>
Low clouds that are relatively close to Earth’s surface emit radiation at warm temperatures similar to the surface. So if both the surface and the low clouds emit blackbody radiation at similar temperatures, then increasing or decreasing the amount of low clouds would have little effect on Earth’s outgoing infrared radiation. But if we think about the incoming solar radiation, low clouds become important. Low clouds generally have high albedos, reflecting back to space up to half of the solar radiation that hits them. Since low clouds have little effect on the energy going out but they do reflect the energy going in, the net effect of low clouds is to cool the Earth. 
</p>
    
<p>
Will there be an increase or decrease in the amount of low clouds under global warming? Model simulations and observations have not been robustly decisive on this point. If there is an increase in low clouds, that would lead to cooling. This would mean that the low clouds could provide a negative feedback. But unlike high clouds, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in the low cloud feedback. Some models have a negative low-cloud feedback while a majority of others have a positive low-cloud feedback.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Soden and Vecchi, <i>The vertical distribution of cloud feedback in coupled ocean-atmosphere models</i>, (2011).</span> 
</p>

<p>      
So if high clouds provide a positive feedback and low clouds could be either a negative feedback or a positive feedback, which one wins out? Most evidence so far indicates that the combined cloud feedback is positive.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Soden and Vecchi, <i>The vertical distribution of cloud feedback in coupled ocean-atmosphere models</i>, (2011).</span> Though this is a very active area of ongoing climate research.

<h2 id="climate-sensitivity">Climate Sensitivity</h2>       
      
<p>
In this chapter we have discussed the four most important climate feedbacks: albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and cloud. While there are other feedbacks, they are small compared to these four and don’t contribute significantly to the overall feedback of the climate system. With both positive and negative feedback processes in the climate system, it’s not clear at first glance what the overall response to global warming will be. For example, we saw that tropical convection could lead to both a negative lapse-rate feedback and also a positive high-cloud feedback. How do all of these combine and which are most important? 
</p>
    
<p>
To explore this, let’s return to the equations from the first part of this chapter. We found that a change in temperature due to a change in radiative forcing, accounting for feedbacks, could be described by the following equation,

\[\Delta T = \frac{\lambda \Delta R}{1-f} \; .\]
    
We computed that a no-atmosphere planet would have a climate sensitivity parameter of \(\lambda = 0.27\,\text{m}^2\text{K}/\text{W}\). For Earth with a realistic atmosphere, but with feedbacks turned off, it turns out that \(\lambda = 0.31\,\text{m}^2\text{K}/\text{W}\). We know that the feedbacks \(f\) are going to have to be calculated based on what the climate system is like. Though we should note that for a stable climate system \(-\infty &lt; f &lt; 1\). But what value should we use for \(\Delta R\), the change in radiative forcing? There have been many different radiative forcings that the Earth has experienced and because we don’t know for sure how humans will act in the future, we don’t know what the cumulative radiative forcing will be due to global warming once it is all done. A useful experimental framework that makes this easier and more unified is to use a \(\Delta R\) that represents a doubling of \(\text{CO}_2\) from preindustrial levels. As you may recall from a previous assignment, the total radiative forcing from any doubling of \(\text{CO}_2\) in Earth’s atmosphere is approximately the same (e.g., going from 10 ppm to 20 ppm or 400 ppm to 800 ppm). In a realistic Earth atmosphere this works out to be \(\Delta R = 4\, \text{W}/\text{m}^2\). 
</p>
    
<p>
The annual- and global-mean surface air temperature response to a doubling of \(\text{CO}_2\) is known as the ‘climate sensitivity’. Climate sensitivity is a central topic in the science of global warming. In fact many debates about global warming are often debates about the numeric value of Earth’s climate sensitivity because it is the theoretical concept that explains how much warming we can expect to see. 
</p>
    
<p>
If there were no feedbacks, what would Earth’s climate sensitivity be (denoted as \(\Delta T_{2xCO2}\))? With \(f = 0\) and using the values of \(\Delta R\) and \(\lambda\) above, we have that \(\Delta T_{2xCO2} = 1.24\, \text{K}\). What about if we add in the ice albedo feedback, \(f_a\)? The current best estimate<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Sherwood, et al., <i>An Assessment of Earth’s Climate Sensitivity Using Multiple Lines of Evidence</i>, (2020).</span> of \(f_a\) is 0.09, so that works out to \(\Delta T_{2xCO2} = 1.36\, \text{K}\). So the albedo feedback only increases the temperature by about 0.1 degree, which isn’t much. 
</p>
    
<p>
What if we put them all together? The total feedback factor is equal to the sum of the albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and cloud feedback factors, so \(f=f_a+f_w+f_\Gamma+f_c=0.59\), a value based on recent estimates.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Sherwood, et al., <i>An Assessment of Earth’s Climate Sensitivity Using Multiple Lines of Evidence</i>, (2020).</span> The climate sensitivity including all these feedbacks comes out to \(\Delta T_{2xCO2} = 3.05\, \text{K}\). So a doubling of \(\text{CO}_2\) is estimated to result in about 3 degrees of global-mean warming. If we compare this value with the no-feedbacks case, we see that feedbacks amplify the warming and contribute about 2 degrees for a \(\text{CO}_2\) doubling. This is a big difference. The global warming we’ve experienced thus far since the 1800s is about 1.3 K. If there were no climate feedbacks, keeping global warming in check would be much easier.
</p>
    
<p>
A very important issue we’ve so far neglected in this discussion about climate sensitivity is the uncertainties involved. The calculations we’ve made here are for the average estimates of \(\Delta R\), \(\lambda\), and \(f\). If you include the uncertainties in each, climate sensitivity is not a single value but actually a distribution of values. And then if you include different kinds of calculations, that can produce different distributions! One ambitious study<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Sherwood, et al., <i>An Assessment of Earth’s Climate Sensitivity Using Multiple Lines of Evidence</i>, (2020).</span> set out to include as much information as reasonably possible to estimate climate sensitivity. The most important distribution to look at is the black ‘Baseline PDF’ plotted below. 
</p>

</figure>    
    
<p>
You can see that the most likely value of climate sensitivity is about 3 K. But the distribution spans a fairly wide range with the 5th to 95th percentile range being 2.3-4.7 K. Smaller values indicate a climate that is less sensitive to radiative forcing while higher values indicate a climate that is more sensitive. Note also that the distributions are ‘fat tail’ distributions: high values of climate sensitivity cannot be ruled out until about 7 K.
