<h2 id="solving-global-warming">‘Solving’ Global Warming</h2>    
    
<p>
Solving global warming is hard for practical as well as psychological reasons. 
</p>
    
<p>
On the practical side, consider the materials that have been called ‘the four pillars of modern civilization’: ammonia, plastics, steel, and concrete.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Smil, <i>How the World Really Works</i>, (2022).</span> Ammonia (NH3) is used as a source of nitrogen to fertilize crops. Because nitrogen is the usual limiting factor in crop growth, without ammonia, total world crop yields would be half of what they currently are.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Smil, <i>How the World Really Works</i>, (2022).</span> But the production of ammonia through the ‘Haber-Bosch’ process is completely dependent on the greenhouse gas methane. Plastics are almost entirely derived from methane or crude oil. Steel is made by smelting iron ore with limestone and ‘coking’ coal. Concrete is produced by heating ground limestone, clay, and other materials, which process releases large amounts of CO2.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">About 3% of <i>all</i> global CO2 emissions, which is about the same as the emissions due to heating all the world’s residential buildings (see figure in the following section).</span> Additionally, all of these four materials are usually made by directly burning fossil fuels or through power plants that are run on fossil fuels. 
</p>
    
<p>
So we ‘eat’ fossil fuels and we make the world’s products, homes, and cities out of fossil fuels. Annual world production of these ‘pillar’ materials are in the hundreds of millions to billions of tons.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Smil, <i>How the World Really Works</i>, (2022).</span> It is no easy task to fundamentally ‘decarbonize’ these essential materials by producing them in ways that do not use fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases.
</p>
    
<p>
It would be challenging to create a problem that is psychologically harder to solve than global warming. People respond best to threats that are local, that they can see, and that impact them immediately. But CO2 emitted in one place, goes into the global atmosphere. And CO2 is invisible and doesn’t have a smell or taste. Emitting CO2, by, for example, driving around in a normal car, doesn’t immediately and obviously impact your daily life. While some of the impacts are felt now, they will disproportionately affect future generations: we emit the CO2 now, but it’s our children and grandchildren who pay the biggest price. 
</p>
    
<p>
Given these challenges, I think it’s a tremendously bad idea to frame global warming as a problem that must be completely solved. If it’s framed this way, people simply give up. But global warming is not an ‘all or nothing’ kind of problem and we can not give up! Even partial fixes will do good! And perhaps, in the process of making many partial fixes, we will end up actually ‘solving’ global warming.
</p>

<h2 id="big-picture">The Big Picture</h2>     
    
<p>
There are many people who believe that global warming could be solved if we did ‘just one particular thing’, with that particular thing being whatever they are personally passionate about. Or in polls people think that one particular activity, usually driving a car, produces the majority of greenhouse gases. But the reality is that greenhouse gas emissions come from a huge variety of sources, and so addressing each particular source would be its own partial fix of global warming.
</p>

<p>
The organization ‘<a href="https://drawdown.org">Project Drawdown</a>’ has gathered together perhaps the most comprehensive collection of global warming fixes. The video below presents their ‘Roadmap’ to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It provides an excellent big picture view of the kinds of things that can most plausibly be done now to address global warming.
</p>

</figure>    
    
<p>
The figure below summarizes the primary actions in Project Drawdown’s ‘Roadmap’, categorized by whether it relates to greenhouse gas emission sources or sinks, or whether it is an issue directly related to society. You can learn more about each one by clicking on the topic in their <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" target="_blank">big list</a>, which you can sort by largest impact.

<img src="img/drawdown-roadmap.jpg" alt="Drawdown Roadmap" />
</figure>
    
<p>
How will these actions (or ‘Roadmap’) actually be accomplished? You may have noticed that the video above didn’t specify who exactly would implement the different actions they proposed. The video mentions governments, investors, and individuals as potentially implementing these actions.
</p>

<p>    
There are two general approaches that have been advocated for in implementing these kinds of global warming fixes. I’ll call these two approaches the ‘United Nations approach’ and the ‘Hartwell approach’, named after the organizations that have most prominently advocated for them.
</p>
    
<p>
The United Nations approach argues that ‘global’ warming must be addressed through global governance and policy. The aim of this approach is to bring as many nations as possible together to get them to agree to common, legally-binding climate policies. There have been many United Nations climate conferences since the mid-1990s. None of them has ended with a genuine, truly legally-binding breakthrough, though some have made important progress (such as the 2015 ‘Paris Agreement’).
</p>
    
<p>
The Hartwell approach<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Prins et al., <i>The Hartwell Paper: a new direction for climate policy after the crash of 2009</i>, (2010); Rayner and Caine, eds., <i>The Hartwell approach to climate policy</i>, (2014).</span> argues that the United Nations approach will ultimately fail because it treats global warming as an issue that can be fixed by policies. It argues that decarbonization will only happen indirectly and locally: organizations and local governments can fix immediate societal problems that have the <i>additional</i> benefit of partially fixing global warming. An example of this would be the problem of air pollution due to burning coal: local governments should replace coal power plants with clean alternatives because the pollution from burning coal is killing people. The Hartwell approach is similar to the discussion of ‘maximizing co-benefits’ in the Project Drawdown video.
</p>
 
<p>
I’m a pragmatist about all sorts of things in life and I’d be happy for either general approach to work or a mix of the two. My personal view is that it’s important to allow for and be aware of <i>many</i> general approaches to fixing global warming. I don’t think we should be so single-minded and ideological about one general approach that we ignore others that can make real progress.
