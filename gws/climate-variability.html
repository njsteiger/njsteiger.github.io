<h2 id="climate-weather">Climate and Weather </h2>    
    
<p>
What is the difference between climate and weather? It is intuitively clear what the weather is—it is the day-to-day state of the atmosphere at some location, usually with particular reference to such things as temperature, windiness, and precipitation. It is also intuitively clear that when we speak of climate we wish to average out all these day-to-day fluctuations and refer to some kind of average of the weather. But what precisely? There is no ideal definition of climate, but a useful working notion is that climate is the statistics of the weather—the mean, the standard deviation, and so forth. But do how we calculate the statistics—how do we take the mean, for example? And if climate is a time average of the weather, then how can climate have any temporal variability?
</p>
    
<p>
Although it is rather fanciful, it is useful to envision a thought experiment in which we take the ensemble average of the weather. Thus, we envision a large number of identical planet Earths, forced the same way, but each one started out in a slightly different way so that each has different weather. We could then unambiguously define the climate to be the average, along with other relevant statistical quantities like the variance, over the ensemble of planet Earths. If the forcing were to change, perhaps because the \(\text{CO}_2\) levels in the planets were to increase, then the climate of the ensemble would also change.
</p>
    
<p>
The problem with this definition is that it is not practical, there is no such ensemble in reality. However, we can try to take our average in such a way that it mimics the ensemble average as closely as possible, and this way of proceeding will be useful to the extent that the weather and climate have different time and space scales. We could then define climate as the average of the weather over a time period long enough so that weather fluctuations are averaged out but variability on longer timescales is still allowed. Weather typically varies on timescales of a few days to a few weeks, so that we might define climate as the average weather over time periods longer than a month. In practice, this time period is too short for many purposes because the monthly average temperature still fluctuates considerably, and a more common definition takes the climate to be the average (along with other statistical quantities) over a period of a few years, with the precise averaging period depending on what quantity is of interest. We might choose to take the average over a particular time of year—only over the winter months, for example, and so obtain a winter climatology. If we are interested in how climate varies across ice ages, then averaging over a period of centuries or even millennia might be appropriate, but if we are interested in whether climate changed over the course of the twentieth century, a much shorter period is obviously more appropriate.
</p>
    
<p>
The moral of the above discussion is that, although it is useful to think of the climate as some kind of average, there is no compact single definition of climate that is useful and appropriate for all purposes, and we are often better served by talking about the climate with reference to a particular timescale. climate varies on more than one timescale—indeed, there may be no timescale on which we can say there is no climate variation.

<h2 id="weekly-variability">Weekly Variability and the Weather</h2> 
    
<p>
On daily and weekly timescales, the main mechanism that causes variations in the temperature and wind is simply the familiar weather. The mechanism that gives rise to weather resides in the atmosphere, and it is the consequence of a fluid instability called baroclinic instability. This instability can be thought of as a type of convective instability in which if a fluid is heated from below it expands, becomes lighter than its surroundings, and therefore rises or ‘convects’. Baroclinic instability has a similar origin, but it also involves the lateral motion of air, with a typical scale of up to a few thousand kilometers and a typical velocity of about 10 m/s. It takes a parcel of air moving at this speed a little more than a day to travel 1,000 km, hence accounting for the typical weather timescale of days to weeks. In midlatitudes, the average temperature difference between two lines of latitude that are 1,000 km apart is about 5°C, and because weather is stirring the air on these space-scales, a typical weather system can lead to typical temperature variations of up to 5°C on timescales of a few days.

<h2 id="monthly-to-seasonal-variability">Monthly to Seasonal Variability</h2>     
    
<p>
The cycle of the seasons arises because of the tilt of Earth’s axis. As the Earth goes around the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer when it points most toward the Sun and it experiences winter when it points most away from the Sun. If Earth were not tilted at all but spun along an axis that was straight up and down, the amount of sunlight would be the same in a given place all year round and therefore there would be no seasons. 
</p>
    
<p>
If we think of a season as lasting roughly three months, are there any climate phenomena that have timescales between the weather timescale and the seasonal timescale? The answer is, to a degree yes, there is at least one such phenomenon, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is a phenomenon at the interface between weather and climate that dictates variability on a monthly timescale over the North Atlantic and surrounding regions, thus from the eastern seaboard of the United States, over Greenland, to Europe, and from the Arctic region to the Canaries. Indeed, to some extent the NAO affects the weather and climate over the entire Northern Hemisphere. There is an analogue of the NAO in the Southern Hemisphere (called the Southern Annular Mode), although it has a more hemispheric extent.
</p>
    
<p>
So what is the NAO? It may be thought of as a north–south oscillation of the main patterns of weather variability over the Atlantic region, especially in the winter, as illustrated below:
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">A schematic of the two phases of the NAO. The positive phase of the NAO (+NAO) shows storms tracking northward bringing mild but wet weather to northern Europe. The negative phase (-NAO) shows storms tracking southward bringing wet weather to southern Europe and colder weather to northern Europe. Adapted from Vallis, <i>Climate and the Oceans</i>, 2011.</span>
<img src="img/vallis-nao-schematic.png" alt="NAO phases" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
During the ‘positive phase’ of the NAO, the main path of weather systems tracks a little further north than usual. Because the air is coming straight over the ocean, it tends to be relatively warm and so brings warm, wet weather to the United Kingdom and other parts of northern Europe, with precipitation often falling as rain rather than snow in the United Kingdom, with similar effects downstream into eastern Europe and even Asia. Southern Europe and North Africa tend to have somewhat cooler weather than usual during these periods. Meanwhile, stronger northerly and northeasterly winds over Greenland and northeastern Canada bring cold, dry air to these parts, decreasing the temperature, with the eastern parts of the United States getting higher temperatures and more precipitation than normal, rather like northern Europe.
</p>
    
<p>
During the ‘negative phase’ of the NAO, the storm track swings southward, bringing mild, wet weather to southern Europe. During these periods, northern Europe tends to receive air that has come from the east, which, since it has come from a continental land mass in winter, tends to be very cold, with precipitation often in the form of snow. Greenland, on the other hand, is now somewhat warmer than usual. The signal of the NAO is evidently quite large and coherent and in fact accounts for about one-third of the northern Hemisphere’s interannual surface variance during winter.
</p>
    
<p>
The distinctive pattern of the NAO, whether positive or negative, tends to last for several days to a few weeks, perhaps a little longer than regular weather patterns, but undoubtedly the main mechanism for the NAO lies in the atmosphere itself. However, there may be a longer timescale to the NAO, as we can see below:
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">The NAO index from 1860 to 2005.

<img src="img/vallis-nao-index.png" alt="NAO phases" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
Large changes in the NAO index occur from year to year, and on the whole atmospheric behavior in one winter is largely independent of its behavior the previous winter. (The correlation in the NAO index from one year to another is only about 0.1.) nevertheless, there is some indication that there are certain periods of time when the NAO persists from year to year. For example, from about 1905 to 1915 the NAO index was largely positive. It was negative from about 1950 to 1970, and then unusually positive in the 1980s and 1990s. Among other things, the positive index in the 1980s and 1990s brought higher than usual precipitation to Scandinavia and may have ameliorated the effects of global warming in the retreat of the glaciers. In contrast, over the Alps, a positive NAO index and less than normal precipitation may have worked in conjunction with global warming to cause a significant retreat of the Alpine glaciers. The Iberian peninsula and other areas around the Mediterranean also experienced drought in the late twentieth century.
</p>

<p>
It is an open question whether such long periods of persistent behavior are much more than the random variations of a chaotic system (rather like throwing six sixes in a row with a die) or whether they have a specific cause, most likely in the ocean. Why is the cause most likely in the ocean? It is because the timescales of the interannual variability correspond most closely to the timescales occurring in large-scale ocean dynamics. The dominant internal dynamics of the atmosphere are most likely too short to produce coherent dynamics that last over decadal timescales, whereas the dynamics of land ice sheets, or of changes in insolation at the top of the atmosphere because of orbital variations, are too long. One possibility is that volcanoes can have a climatic effect on the decadal timescale, but the correlation of the NAO with volcanoes is small. So let us look at the role of the ocean.
</p>

<h2 id="oceanic-climate-variability">Oceanic Influence on Climate Variability</h2>     
    
<p>
The ocean has one unambiguous influence on midlatitude climate variability and a number of more ambiguous influences. The unambiguous influence comes from the fact that the heat capacity of the ocean is much greater than that of land. This means that the ocean moderates climate; the ocean takes in heat when the overlying atmosphere is hot, storing that energy and releasing it when the atmosphere is cold. 
</p>
    
<p>
For an example of this, take two cities: San Francisco and New York. The two cities have similar latitudes (San Francisco is at about 38°N and New York is at about 41°N) and both are on the coast, yet we see from the figure below that the range of the annual cycle of temperatures is much larger in New York—the highs are higher and the lows are lower.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">The seasonal cycle of temperature (°C) in San Francisco and New York. For each city, the plot shows the average low temperature and the average high temperature for each month. Note the much bigger range in New York and the maximum earlier in the year, in July rather than September. Vallis, <i>Climate and the Oceans</i>, 2011.</span>
<img src="img/vallis-SF-NYC.png" alt="SF and NYC" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
The difference is mainly caused by the fact that the climate of San Francisco is maritime, meaning that it is influenced by the ocean, whereas the climate of New York is, in spite of it being on the Atlantic coast, essentially continental. A city that is truly land-locked, such as Moscow, has a climate much more like New York than San Francisco. New York’s climate is continental because the mean winds come primarily from the west, so they blow over land and take up its temperatures before they reach the city. In contrast, the winds have blown over the Pacific ocean before arriving at San Francisco.
</p>
    
<p>
The more ambiguous effect of the ocean on climate concerns the relationship between fluctuations in the sea-surface temperature (SST) and the state of the atmosphere in midlatitudes, and in particular the state of the NAO. Certainly, variations in the SST and the overlying atmosphere are related. To be specific, let us focus on the North Atlantic and the NAO, but similar effects apply to other regions of the world’s ocean. It turns out that a common pattern of SST variability in the North Atlantic winter is a tripole. Rather like the NAO itself, the tripole commonly exists in one of two phases. In one phase, the pattern consists of a cold anomaly in the subpolar North Atlantic around Greenland, a warm anomaly in the middle latitudes off the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, and a cold subtropical anomaly between the equator and 30°N, concentrated most in the eastern Atlantic. Is the SST pattern created by the pattern of variability of winds and temperature in the atmosphere, or does the SST pattern determine the variability of the atmospheric winds and temperature? It may of course be a chicken-and-egg problem, with one pattern leading to the other, which then reinforces the first pattern, and so on. How are we to determine the answer? One way is to see if we can determine if variations in the atmosphere unambiguously lead those in the ocean, or vice versa. If it is the former case, then it seems likely that the atmosphere is driving the ocean, rather than vice versa.
</p>
    
<p>
Careful observational analysis in fact suggests that the basic pattern of SST anomalies is created by air–sea heat exchanges and the wind-induced near-surface ocean currents associated with the NAO. It seems that the correlations between atmosphere and ocean are strongest for atmospheric patterns that exist before the SST variability by a few weeks. This means that large-scale SST patterns are responding to atmospheric forcing, rather than causing the atmospheric patterns. Put simply, the atmosphere leads the ocean. 
</p>
    
<p>
However, rather intriguingly, that may not be the whole story, although the reader should be warned that the situation is far from settled and is an active topic of research. At still longer timescales, there is some evidence that a large-scale, pan-Atlantic SST pattern actually precedes the atmospheric NAO pattern by up to about six months.1 It is possible that the ocean’s own internal circulating variability could influence the NAO, giving it more long-lived features or persistence than it would otherwise have.

<h2 id="enso">El Niño and the Southern Oscillation</h2> 
    
<p>
El Niño is the largest and most important phenomenon in global climate variability on interannual timescales. In brief, it is an anomalous warming of the surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, most pronounced just off the coast of Peru but extending westward to the center of the Pacific Ocean.
</p>
    
<p>
El Niño is often called ‘the El Niño—Southern Oscillation’ or ENSO. The Southern Oscillation is the atmospheric part of the phenomenon, and El Niño is the oceanic component; ENSO is the combination. However, unless we need to be particularly precise, we often just use the term El Niño, for this has a pleasant euphony lacking in the acronym ENSO.2
</p>
    
<p>
Every few years the temperature of the surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific rises quite significantly. The strongest warming takes place between about 5°S and 5°N, and from the west coast of Peru (a longitude of about 80° W) almost to the dateline at 180° W, as illustrated below:
</p>

(b) The SST in a strong El Niño year (December 1997). (c) The difference between panel (b) and (a). A normal year is characterized by a cold tongue of water in the eastern tropical Pacific, which disappears in El Niño years. Vallis, <i>Climate and the Oceans</i>, 2011.</span>
<img src="img/vallis-elnino.png" alt="El Nino" />
</figure>     
    
<p>
This region usually warms by 6°C during an El Niño year compared to a non–El Niño year. The warmings occur rather irregularly, but typically the interval between warmings ranges from three to seven years:
</p>

The spiky curve shows the annual means, and the dots represent Decembers. The smoother curve shows the SST after the application of a 20-year low-pass filter, and the top of the gray bar is the 1876–1975 mean. Bottom: A similar plot for the negative of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the anomalous pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin Australia. Particularly large El Niño events can be seen in 1877–78, 1982–83, and 1997–98. Vallis, <i>Climate and the Oceans</i>, 2011.</span>
<img src="img/vallis-nino-soi.png" alt="El Nino and SOI" />
</figure> 
    
<p>
The warmings have become known as El Niño events, or even (with a little violence to the Spanish language) El Niños. The name derives from the fact that the warm waters off Peru appear at about Christmas time, and the name El Niño is Spanish for the Christ Child. The warmings typically last for up to a year, sometimes two, and appear as an enhancement to the seasonal cycle, with high temperatures appearing at a time when the waters are already warming. Although there is no universally agreed-upon definition of an El Niño, an event is often regarded as having occurred when there is a warming of at least 0.5°C averaged over the eastern tropical Pacific lasting for six months or more.4 Rarely can a year be described as truly normal; rather, the ocean temperatures tend to fluctuate between warm El Niño years and years in which the equatorial ocean temperatures are colder in the east and warmer in the west, with those years that are particularly anomalous this way having become known as La Niña events (Spanish for ‘the young girl’). We have direct observational evidence of El Niño events for more than a century, but the events have almost certainly gone on for a much longer time, perhaps millennia or longer. We know this through a variety of proxy records including tree rings and corals. 
</p>
    
<p>
Our knowledge of El Niño began with observations of the SST off the coast of Peru, but it is now understood that the phenomenon itself is Pacific-wide and also involves the atmosphere. Observations of the winds and the surface pressure in the equatorial Pacific show that these tend to covary with the SST. In particular, during El Niño events the equatorial Pacific trade winds, which normally blow toward the west, become much weaker and may even reverse. One useful measure is the pressure difference between Darwin, at the far north of Australia (12°S, 130°E), and Tahiti (17°S, 150°W), an island in the Pacific; the record of this difference is known as the Southern Oscillation. (There is nothing truly special about these locations vis-à-vis El Niño, but pressure measurements have been made there for a long time.) We saw in the previous figure above that the Southern Oscillation and the SST record of El Niño are highly correlated.
