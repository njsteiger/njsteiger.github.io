<h2 id="planet-b">There is No Planet B</h2>

<p>    
Big environmental problems come with high stakes. And when thinking about the range of possible risks these problems might incur, it can be helpful to start with the worst-case scenario. From there we can work our way down to the most likely set of risks we face. This will give us the widest view of what could happen under global warming.
</p>
    
<p>    
In a not-impossible worst-case scenario where the Earth is heated up to a moist or runaway greenhouse state (discussed in <a href="climate-feedbacks-sensitivity.html#watervapor-feedback">Chapter 8</a>), we would then have caused the permanent collapse of life on Earth. While this is quite unlikely to occur (a 1 in 1000 chance over the next 100 years<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ord, <i>The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</i>, (2020).</span>), it’s mere possibility shows that the stakes are high. We have the power to inadvertently ruin everything. 
</p>
    
<p>
Our power of planetary destruction does not come with a counter-balancing power of planetary creation. The only other planet we can even contemplate inhabiting is Mars. Though many people over the past several decades have discussed colonizing and ‘terraforming’ Mars, this is actually a dangerous fantasy. 
</p>
    
<p>
It’s dangerous because it can appear to absolve us of actually improving conditions on Earth. If we can just inhabit another planet, why bother fixing this one if it appears to be going very badly? 
</p>
    
<p>
And it’s a fantasy because it’s impossible to turn Mars into a version of Earth. The surface of Mars is irradiated with sterilizing high-energy photons and cosmic rays. With an average temperature of -65ºC, its greenhouse effect is far too small to warm the surface up to Earth-like temperatures. And even if all of Mars’ polar CO2-ice caps were sublimated into its atmosphere and all of Mars’ carbonate rocks were strip-mined and processed to release CO2, its CO2-dominated atmosphere would still be two orders of magnitude too thin to make it as warm as Earth.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Jakosky and Edwards, <i>Inventory of CO2 available for terraforming Mars</i>, (2018)</span> Mars is also missing plate tectonics and any substantial amounts of available water, and thus it is impossible for it to have a weathering-CO2 thermostat like Earth; this means that Mars could never self-stabilize its temperature over geological time scales. The very best that human life could ever be on Mars would be like the lives of small groups of scientists near the South Pole: cold, harsh, restricted, and lonely.
</p>
    
<p>
So if, through a combination of very poor decision making and very bad luck, we manage to completely ruin things on Earth, there is no planet B.

<p>
But what are the most likely risks due to global warming and how do we know about them? Ultimately all knowledge about any scientific area comes from the work of scientists working mostly in teams or small groups. This scientific knowledge is conveyed through articles written by the scientists. The field of climate science is unusual in that it also works collectively through large organizations that coordinate and plan research work and experiments. The largest of these is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most often called ‘the IPCC’. The following video explains more about the IPCC and interviews a number of scientists who have worked on the IPCC.
</p>
    
<figure class="iframe-wrapper">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UH21l15Af3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"></span>
</figure>     
    
<p>
The IPCC has so far generated a new report every 5-7 years since 1990. The latest ‘Sixth Assessment Report’ was released in late 2021. These reports have helped to coordinate a huge amount of research work, especially the coordination of a series of model simulations. This coordination is particularly valuable because of the complexity of the problems and global climate models involved. 
</p>
    
<p>
To understand the value of this coordination, let’s look at a realistic example. Imagine there’s a small group of 2-4 scientists working together to estimate the impacts of global warming. Typically, such scientists would only have 3 years to work on this project (the usual length of research grants that pay for computing time and student or postdoc or research scientist salaries). The most this group of scientists would be able to do in three years is run a few climate model simulations and do statistical analyses of these results. They likely would not be able to run simulations from more than one or two different climate models and they would have to choose their own simple future scenarios. Because of these limitations their results will likely be highly dependent on the model (or models) and scenario they chose. This means that their conclusions will be fairly limited and not necessarily comparable to other groups of scientists who will be running their own models and their own scenarios for the future. The coordination of the IPCC allows many scientists to agree to a selection of future global warming scenarios and agree to run the same sets of experiments. Thus dozens of groups of scientists can run many dozens of model simulations, all with the same experimental inputs, though using different models. The output of these simulations is then collected together and hosted online so that thousands of climate scientists from all over the world can analyze these standardized model simulations. This means that the results of global warming simulation experiments can be comparable and generalizable and usable by a large number of people. An additional benefit of coordination like this is that the average of many different models is almost always more realistic than any individual model (this is generally true for models across all disciplines of science). Using a broad range of models can therefore give us a sense of what results are most reliable across models.
</p>
    
<p>
What are the agreed-upon global warming scenarios? As of the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC, released in 2021, there are five general scenarios, each of which comes with its own economic and political narrative. These are called the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). The SSPs span a wide range of possible futures. The CO2 emissions of each of these is shown below along with an estimate of global mean temperature from a simple climate model.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Hausfather, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/">Explainer: How ‘Shared Socioeconomic Pathways’ explore future climate change</a>, Carbon Brief (19 April 2018).</span><img src="img/ssp-co2-gmt-scenarios-hausfather.png" alt="SSP scenarios" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
These narratives describe alternative pathways for future society. SSP1 and SSP5 envision optimistic trends for human development, with ‘substantial investments in education and health, rapid economic growth, and well-functioning institutions’. They differ in that SSP5 assumes this will be driven by an energy-intensive, fossil fuel-based economy, while in SSP1 there’s a shift toward sustainable practices. SSP3 and SSP4 are more pessimistic in their future economic and social development. These scenarios have little investment in education or health in poorer countries where there are also fast-growing populations and increasing inequality. SSP2 represents a ‘middle of the road’ scenario where historical patterns of development are continued throughout the 21st century.
</p>
    
<p>
The IPCC report doesn’t say that any particular scenario is more or less likely than any another. Independent analyses have indicated that the middle scenarios (SSP2, SSP3, SSP4) are unsurprisingly the most probable. But there are still good economic reasons to not dismiss the low- and high-end scenarios, SSP1 and SSP5; in one study, subjective economic expert forecasts have suggested that there’s a 35% chance that the real future emissions scenario could exceed the most severe SSP5 scenario.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Christensen, Gillingham, and Nordhaus, <i>Uncertainty in forecasts of long-run economic growth</i>, (2018).</span> But as Niels Bohr famously quipped, ‘Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.’ 
</p>
    
<p>
In addition to the baseline SSP scenarios, there are also variations on the SSP scenarios that correspond to specific amounts of total radiative forcing by 2100: a range of values from 8.5 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) to 1.9 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\). For example, if a scenario is labeled ‘SSP2-4.5’, this means SSP scenario 2 with 4.5 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) of radiative forcing (a global radiative imbalance) due to greenhouse gas emissions by 2100. In this and the next chapter you will see figures labeled with such scenarios (these scenario variations are indicated with the thin lines in the first figure showing the SSP scenarios above).
</p>
    
<!--
<p>
Yet another way of showing the results of different scenarios is to show the climate impacts due to a certain amount of global mean temperature warming. For example, the figure below shows what the average patterns of temperature and precipitation will be for a three different global warming levels. Notice that different combinations of SSP scenarios can lead to a particular amount of warming; some scenarios with some climate models arrive at a particular warming sooner than others. So while figures that use a global warming level, as illustrated below, don’t tell you anything about particular SSP scenarios, they do have the advantage of simplicity. Instead of keeping five different scenarios each with their own variations in mind, you can look at the climate impacts for one or two (or maybe more) global mean temperature values.

<h2 id="econ-risks">Climate Sensitivity and Economic Risks</h2>     
    
<p>
The economic impacts of global warming will depend not only on the amount of greenhouse gases we emit but also on Earth’s true climate sensitivity. Recall that climate sensitivity is defined as the global mean temperature response to a doubling of CO2. It is reasonable to expect that we will eventually emit more than a doubling of CO2; for the SSP ‘middle of the road’ scenario, CO2 levels will eventually reach about 700 ppm. Also recall that when accounting for uncertainties, the estimate of climate sensitivity is a fat-tailed distribution, skewed towards the higher values. So the temperature change for an eventual CO2 level of 700 ppm would be given by the following distribution.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Adapted from: Wagner and Weitzman, <i>Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet</i>, (2015).</span><img src="img/fat-tail-clim-sense-10pct-risk.png" alt="Fat tail of climate sensitivity" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
Because the distribution is fat-tailed, the highest values can’t be ruled out. For example, there’s a 10% chance that the Earth will warm by more than 6ºC (as indicated on the figure), which is more than double the most likely estimate. A 10% chance might feel unlikely, but many personal catastrophes (like a house fire or severe car accident) that we spend a lot of effort and money to insure against are far less probable. A truly rational response to global warming ought to take very seriously the possibility of ‘unlikely’ extreme warming.
</p>
    
<p>
What will the economic impacts be of an unlikely extreme global warming? A big challenge in figuring that out is that it’s very hard to estimate unobserved extremes. The standard approach in economics is to use observed historical events and data to estimate the impacts of similar events that may occur in the future. Such estimations are done by statistically fitting mathematical functions to observed data. The problem is that the observed data are often consist with very different kinds of mathematical functions. As shown below, Earth has so far warmed by about 1ºC and this can’t constrain what will happen for extreme warming; for global economic damages, both quadratic and exponential functions can fit the observed data but they give very different responses for a warming of 6ºC. Because of this, the economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman write, ‘We don’t know the full implications of an eventual 6ºC temperature change. We can’t know. It’s a blind planetary gamble.’<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Wagner and Weitzman, <i>Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet</i>, (2015).</span>

<h2 id="sea-level-rise">Sea Level Rise</h2>     
    
<p>
While the economic risks of global warming are very hard to estimate, the climate system is governed by more predictable laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. And probably the most commonly known physical impact of global warming is sea level rise. 
</p>
    
<p>
Sea level, like temperature, has been remarkably stable over the course of human civilization. Consider this perspective from the past 20,000 years:
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Long-term global mean sea-level change for the past 20,000 years (black line) based on palaeo sea level records (black dots with depth uncertainties shown by blue vertical lines).

</figure>    
    
<p>
Sea level was about 130 m lower during the last ice age. But from the time that agriculture began, animals were domesticated, and civilizations were constructed, sea level has been very stable. The problem is that we are not like our ancient ancestors, living in small groups of highly mobile hunter gatherers. In comparison, our cities are immensely populous and their form and boundaries are practically permanent. 
</p>    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">The shoreline of Lower Manhattan, New York City, USA. Max Touhey.</span><img src="img/manhattan-coastline-max-touhey.webp" alt="NYC Coastline" />
</figure>    
<p>    
When the ice sheets of the last ice age melted away from about 20,000 years ago to 7,000 years ago, it caused an average sea level rise of 1 cm/year. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have been unlikely to have even noticed this kind of a change. But for a large, modern coastal city this kind of sea level rise would end up being disastrous. 
</p>
    
<p>
What causes sea level rise? The two most important factors are the melting of ice on land and the expansion of ocean water as it is heated. Since 1900, the melting of ice on land has contributed twice as much to sea level rise than thermal expansion.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Frederikse, et al., <i>The causes of sea-level rise since 1900</i>, (2020).</span> Note that the melting of <i>floating</i> sea ice contributes only a tiny amount to sea level rise.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">According to Archimedes’ Principle, a floating object displaces the same volume of water as the volume of the part of the object that’s submerged. So removing a boat from the ocean doesn’t change the ocean’s height. The subtle trick with sea ice is that when it is melted into the ocean it changes the average density and therefore the volume of the ocean. But this effect is small and so Archimedes’ Principle ensures that there’s only a small contribution of melting sea ice to sea level rise (Jenkins and Holland, <i>Melting of floating ice and sea level rise</i>, 2007).</span>  
</p>
    
<p>
How is sea level projected to change under global warming? Ice melts and the ocean warms and expands, so the sea level will rise. Uncertainty in how much it will rise comes from how much greenhouse gases we will emit and how Greenland and Antarctica’s ice sheets respond to warming. Depending on the SSP scenario, sea level rise by 2150 could be anywhere between about 0.5 m to 1.5 m, see figure below. But if there were a collapse of large ice sheets, particularly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, then sea level could rise by about 3-6 m by 2150 with many more meters of sea level rise guaranteed to come after that.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">DeConto et al., <i>The Paris Climate Agreement and future sea-level rise from Antarctica</i>, (2021).</span>

How could a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet happen and why would it be so impactful? The following video explains the key ideas.

<p>
Let’s return back to the long-view of sea level rise that we began this section with. Sea level has been remarkably stable for thousands of years. How will it change in the coming few thousands of years? We’ve learned that because of the relatively slow weathering-CO2 thermostat, extra CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, so it can continue to have an impact far into the future. Ice sheets also respond very slowly to temperature changes and can continue to melt for many hundreds of years even though the warming may have ceased. Depending on how much carbon we burn, from approximately all known usable fossil fuels (~5000 Gton C) down to about &frac14; of all fossil fuels, the eventual sea level rise will be between about 25-50 m (figure below). 
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Long-term global mean sea-level change for the past 20,000 years (black line) based on palaeo sea level records (black dots with depth uncertainties shown by blue vertical lines) and projections for the next 10,000 years for four emission scenarios (1280, 2560, 3840, and 5120 Gton C). Images show reconstructions of the Greenland (top) and Antarctic (bottom) ice sheets for today (left) and for the 5120 Gton C emission scenario (right).

<p>
The lowest of these four scenarios above (1280 Gton C) results in 25 meters of eventual sea level rise. Since 1750 we’ve already burned approximately 600 Gton C, so we’re already half way to this lowest of the four emissions scenarios. Twenty-five meters of sea level rise is enough to bury all or significant portions of many of the world’s largest major cities, see the figure below.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For example, Tel Aviv has an average elevation of 5 meters and a high point of about 20 meters, so it would be completely submerged by 25 meters of sea level rise.</span> Unless we keep the large majority of the usable fossil fuels in the ground, in several hundred to a thousand years we will have to abandon or massively engineer nearly all of the world’s coastal cities.

<h2 id="heat">Heat and Humidity</h2> 
    
<p>
As Earth’s average temperature increases, the range of ‘normal’ temperatures also shifts. As the distributions shift to warmer temperatures with time, we can see in the figure below that temperatures that were extremely warm in the past have become average or even comparatively cold. This basic process therefore increases the number of hot temperature extremes.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Distributions of decadal averages of the ensemble estimates of annual mean global mean temperature from <a href="https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/#datdow">HadCRUT5</a>.</span><img src="img/changing_global_mean_distributions.png" alt="Global Mean Temperature Shifts" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
Extreme warmth can have many kinds of impacts, such as on food crops (discussed below). For high temperatures to directly kill people, they usually have to be accompanied by high humidity. Why is this the case? It has to do with how the body gets rid of heat. If the human body did not get rid of the heat it generates, then it would warm by 1ºC per hour<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Platt and Vicario, <i>Heat Illness</i>, (2013).</span> until it cooks itself from the inside and dies. As long as we have access to water and can sweat, we can work in dry-heat conditions up to about 50ºC.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Buzan and Huber, <i>Moist Heat Stress on a Hotter Earth</i>, (2020).</span> The key mechanism that lets us endure this is our ability to loose heat through evaporation. When we sweat, the excess heat we produce can go into heating and evaporating the water on our skin; this removes heat from our bodies and we cool down. The figure below shows the energy balance of the human body while working or exercising. Evaporation can remove about 75% of the excess heat we produce (though only about 25% when we are at rest).
</p>  
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Energy balance of the human body while sweating during exercise or work.

</figure>     
    
<p>
However this evaporative heating loss can be stopped if we experience humid or moist heat. If the air becomes too hot and too humid, we can no longer lose heat through evaporation and we risk heating up our bodies until they die.
</p> 
    
<p>
Let’s look what could happen under global warming in the cities of Jakarta (Indonesia) and New York City (USA). Currently there are relatively few days per year that are hot enough to directly cause death in these cities. But if we use a combination of historical heat wave data and climate model simulations of global warming, then both these cities see very large increases in the number of deadly heat days. The figure below<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mora et al., <i>Global Risk of Deadly Heat</i>, (2017).</span> shows temperature and humidity from a single model simulation for the year 2005 and the year 2100 under three different CO2 emissions scenarios: RCP 2.6 represents a low-emissions scenario, RCP 4.5 a middle of the road scenario, and RCP 8.5 a high-emissions scenario. The top row of plots are for Jakarta, while the bottom row of plots are for New York City. The average values for all the days of the year are dots that are connected in time by lines. The red line indicates the threshold of temperature and humidity that cause death (values on the right side of the red line are deadly). The numbers on the plots indicate the number of deadly days and the average temperature change in 2100 compared to 2005.

By 2100 in the middle of the road scenario (RCP 4.5), New York City will have about a month’s worth of deadly heat days each year while in Jakarta about 75% of the days will be hot enough to kill. If we look at this same analysis but using many different climate models (below), we see that by the year 2100 most of the tropics will experience deadly heat for a majority of the year. These tropical regions are home to a large fraction of the human population. Depending on the emissions scenario, by 2100 between about 50% to 75% of the world’s population will experience more than 20 days of deadly heat per year.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mora et al., <i>Global Risk of Deadly Heat</i>, (2017).</span>
