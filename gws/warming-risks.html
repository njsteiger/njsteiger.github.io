<h2 id="gw-projections">Global Warming Projections</h2>    
    
<p>
How do we know what we know about global warming? Ultimately all knowledge about any scientific area comes from the work of scientists working mostly in teams or small groups. This scientific knowledge is conveyed through articles written by the scientists. The field of climate science is unusual in that it also works collectively through large organizations that coordinate and plan research work and experiments. The largest of these is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, most often called ‘the IPCC’. The following video explains more about the IPCC and interviews a number of scientists who have worked on the IPCC.
</p>
    
<figure class="iframe-wrapper">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UH21l15Af3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"></span>
</figure>     
    
<p>
The IPCC has so far generated a new report every 5-7 years since 1990. The latest ‘Sixth Assessment Report’ was released in late 2021. These reports have helped to coordinate a huge amount of research work, especially the coordination of a series of model simulations. This coordination is particularly valuable because of the complexity of the problems and global climate models involved. 
</p>
    
<p>
To understand the value of this coordination, let’s look at a realistic example. Imagine there’s a small group of 2-4 scientists working together to estimate the impacts of global warming. Typically, such scientists would only have 3 years to work on this project (the usual length of research grants that pay for computing time and student or postdoc or research scientist salaries). The most this group of scientists would be able to do in three years is run a few climate model simulations and do statistical analyses of these results. They likely would not be able to run simulations from more than one or two different climate models and they would have to choose their own simple future scenarios. Because of these limitations their results will likely be highly dependent on the model (or models) and scenario they chose. This means that their conclusions will be fairly limited and not necessarily comparable to other groups of scientists who will be running their own models and their own scenarios for the future. The coordination of the IPCC allows many scientists to agree to a selection of future global warming scenarios and agree to run the same sets of experiments. Thus dozens of groups of scientists can run many dozens of model simulations, all with the same experimental inputs, though using different models. The output of these simulations is then collected together and hosted online so that thousands of climate scientists from all over the world can analyze these standardized model simulations. This means that the results of global warming simulation experiments can be comparable and generalizable and usable by a large number of people. An additional benefit of coordination like this is that the average of many different models is almost always more realistic than any individual model (this is generally true for models across all disciplines of science). Using a broad range of models can therefore give us a sense of what results are most reliable across models.
</p>
    
<p>
What are the agreed-upon global warming scenarios? As of the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC, released in 2021, there are five general scenarios, each of which comes with its own economic and political narrative. These are called the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). The SSPs span a wide range of possible futures. The CO2 emissions of each of these is show below along with an estimate of global mean temperature from a simple climate model.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Hausfather, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/">Explainer: How ‘Shared Socioeconomic Pathways’ explore future climate change</a>, Carbon Brief (19 April 2018).</span><img src="img/ssp-co2-gmt-scenarios-hausfather.png" alt="SSP scenarios" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
These narratives describe alternative pathways for future society. SSP1 and SSP5 envision optimistic trends for human development, with ‘substantial investments in education and health, rapid economic growth, and well-functioning institutions’. They differ in that SSP5 assumes this will be driven by an energy-intensive, fossil fuel-based economy, while in SSP1 there’s a shift toward sustainable practices. SSP3 and SSP4 are more pessimistic in their future economic and social development. These scenarios have little investment in education or health in poorer countries where there are also fast-growing populations and increasing inequality. SSP2 represents a ‘middle of the road’ scenario where historical patterns of development are continued throughout the 21st century.
</p>
    
<p>
The IPCC report doesn’t say that any particular scenario is more or less likely than any another. Independent analyses have indicated that the middle scenarios (SSP2, SSP3, SSP4) are unsurprisingly the most probable. But there are still good economic reasons to not dismiss the low- and high-end scenarios, SSP1 and SSP5; in one study, subjective economic expert forecasts have suggested that there’s a 35% chance that the real future emissions scenario could exceed the most severe SSP5 scenario.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Christensen, Gillingham, and Nordhaus, <i>Uncertainty in forecasts of long-run economic growth</i>, (2018).</span> But as Niels Bohr famously quipped, ‘Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.’ 
</p>
    
<p>
In addition to the baseline SSP scenarios, there are also variations on the SSP scenarios that correspond to specific amounts of total radiative forcing by 2100: a range of values from 8.5 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) to 1.9 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\). For example, if a scenario is labeled ‘SSP2-4.5’, this means SSP scenario 2 with 4.5 \(\text{W}/\text{m}^2\) of radiative forcing (a global radiative imbalance) due to greenhouse gas emissions by 2100. In this and the next chapter you will see figures labeled with such scenarios (these scenario variations are indicated with the thin lines in the first figure showing the SSP scenarios above).
</p>
    
<p>
Yet another way of showing the results of different scenarios is to show the climate impacts due to a certain amount of global mean temperature warming. For example, the figure below shows what the average patterns of temperature and precipitation will be for a three different global warming levels. Notice that different combinations of SSP scenarios can lead to a particular amount of warming; some scenarios with some climate models arrive at a particular warming sooner than others. So while figures that use a global warming level, as illustrated below, don’t tell you anything about particular SSP scenarios, they do have the advantage of simplicity. Instead of keeping five different scenarios each with their own variations in mind, you can look at the climate impacts for one or two (or maybe more) global mean temperature values.

<h2 id="econ-risks">Climate Sensitivity and Economic Risks</h2>     
    
<p>
The economic impacts of global warming will depend not only on the amount of greenhouse gases we emit but also on Earth’s true climate sensitivity. Recall that climate sensitivity is defined as the global mean temperature response to a doubling of CO2. It is reasonable to expect that we will eventually emit more than a doubling of CO2; for the SSP ‘middle of the road’ scenario, CO2 levels will eventually reach about 700 ppm. Also recall that when accounting for uncertainties, the estimate of climate sensitivity is a fat-tailed distribution, skewed towards the higher values. So the temperature change for an eventual CO2 level of 700 ppm would be given by the following distribution.
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Adapted from: Wagner and Weitzman, <i>Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet</i>, (2015).</span><img src="img/fat-tail-clim-sense-10pct-risk.png" alt="Fat tail of climate sensitivity" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
Because the distribution is fat-tailed, the highest values can’t be ruled out. For example, there’s a 10% chance that the Earth will warm by more than 6ºC (as indicated on the figure), which is more than double the most likely estimate. A 10% chance might feel unlikely, but many personal catastrophes (like a house fire or severe car accident) that we spend a lot of effort and money to insure against are far less probable. A truly rational response to global warming ought to take very seriously the possibility of ‘unlikely’ extreme warming.
</p>
    
<p>
What will the economic impacts be of an unlikely extreme global warming? A big challenge in figuring that out is that it’s very hard to estimate unobserved extremes. The standard approach in economics is to use observed historical events and data to estimate the impacts of similar events that may occur in the future. Such estimations are done by statistically fitting mathematical functions to observed data. The problem is that the observed data are often consist with very different kinds of mathematical functions. As shown below, Earth has so far warmed by about 1ºC and this can’t constrain what will happen for extreme warming; for global economic damages, both quadratic and exponential functions can fit the observed data but they give very different responses for a warming of 6ºC. Because of this, the economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman write, ‘We don’t know the full implications of an eventual 6ºC temperature change. We can’t know. It’s a blind planetary gamble.’<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Wagner and Weitzman, <i>Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet</i>, (2015).</span>

<h2 id="sea-level-rise">Sea Level Rise</h2>     
    
    
<p>
While the economic risks of global warming are very hard to estimate, the climate system is governed by more predictable laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. And probably the most commonly known physical impact of global warming is sea level rise. 
</p>
    
<p>
Sea level, like temperature, has been remarkably stable over the course of human civilization. Consider this perspective from the past 20,000 years:
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Long-term global mean sea-level change for the past 20,000 years (black line) based on palaeo sea level records (black dots with depth uncertainties shown by blue vertical lines).

</figure>    
    
<p>
Sea level was about 130 m lower during the last ice age. But from the time that agriculture began, animals were domesticated, and civilizations were constructed, sea level has been very stable. The problem is that we are not like our ancient ancestors, living in small groups of highly mobile hunter gatherers. In comparison, our cities are immensely populous and their form and boundaries are practically permanent. When the ice sheets of the last ice age melted away from about 20,000 years ago to 7,000 years ago, it caused an average sea level rise of 1 cm/year. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have been unlikely to have even noticed this kind of a change. But for a large, modern coastal city this kind of sea level rise would end up being disastrous. 
</p>
    
<p>
What causes sea level rise? The two most important factors are the melting of ice on land and the expansion of ocean water as it is heated. Since 1900, the melting of ice on land has contributed twice as much to sea level rise than thermal expansion.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Frederikse, et al., <i>The causes of sea-level rise since 1900</i>, (2020).</span> Note that the melting of <i>floating</i> sea ice contributes only a tiny amount to sea level rise. According to Archimedes’ Principle, a floating object displaces the same volume of water as the volume of the part of the object that’s submerged. So removing a boat from the ocean doesn’t change the ocean’s height. The subtle trick with sea ice is that when it is melted into the ocean it changes the average density and therefore the volume of the ocean&mdash;but this effect is small and Archimedes’ Principle dominates the consequences of melting sea ice.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Jenkins and Holland, <i>Melting of floating ice and sea level rise</i>, (2007).</span>  
</p>
    
<p>
How is sea level projected to change under global warming? Ice melts and the ocean warms and expands, so the sea level will rise. Uncertainty in how much it will rise comes from how much greenhouse gases we will emit and how Greenland and Antarctica’s ice sheets respond to warming. Depending on the SSP scenario, sea level rise by 2150 could be anywhere between about 0.5 m to 1.5 m, see figure below. But if there were a collapse of large ice sheets, particularly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, then sea level could rise by about 3-6 m by 2150 with many more meters of sea level rise guaranteed to come after that.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">DeConto et al., <i>The Paris Climate Agreement and future sea-level rise from Antarctica</i>, (2021).</span>

How could a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet happen and why would it be so impactful? The following video explains the key ideas.

<p>
Let’s return back to the long-view of sea level rise that we began this section with. Sea level has been remarkably stable for thousands of years. How will it change in the coming few thousands of years? We’ve learned that because of the relatively slow weathering-CO2 thermostat, extra CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, so it can continue to have an impact far into the future. Ice sheets also respond very slowly to temperature changes and can continue to melt for many hundreds of years even though the warming may have ceased. Depending on how much carbon we burn, from approximately all known usable fossil fuels (~5000 Gton C) down to about &frac14; of all fossil fuels, the eventual sea level rise will be between about 25-50 m (figure below). 
</p>
    
<figure>
<label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Long-term global mean sea-level change for the past 20,000 years (black line) based on palaeo sea level records (black dots with depth uncertainties shown by blue vertical lines) and projections for the next 10,000 years for four emission scenarios (1280, 2560, 3840, and 5120 Gton C).

</figure>     
    
<p>
The lowest of these four scenarios above results in 25 meters of sea level rise. Since 1750 we’ve already burned approximately 600 Gton C, so we’re already half way to this lowest of the four emissions scenarios. Twenty-five meters of sea level rise is enough to bury all or significant portions of many of the world’s largest major cities, see the figure below.<label for="ref1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For example, Tel Aviv has an average elevation of 5 meters and a high point of about 20 meters, so it would be completely submerged by 25 meters of sea level rise.</span> Unless we keep the large majority of the usable fossil fuels in the ground, we will have to eventually abandon or massively engineer nearly all of the world’s coastal cities.
