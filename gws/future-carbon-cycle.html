<h2 id="historic-co2">Historic \(\text{CO}_2\) Levels</h2>    
    
<p>
We have two kinds of direct measurements of past \(\text{CO}_2\) levels in the atmosphere. One comes from ancient bubbles of air trapped in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. We can measure the gases in these bubbles if we extract a core of ice from Antarctica and take it back to a lab and melt it down inside a chamber. The other measurements we have of past atmospheric \(\text{CO}_2\) were made using scientific equipment starting with the work of David Keeling in 1957 that we read about in Chapter 1. If you stitch these two kinds of records together, this is what we get for atmospheric \(\text{CO}_2\) over the past 800,000 years:

</figure>    
    
<p>
We see fluctuations between 180 ppm and 280 ppm during the ice age cycles, followed by a steady ~280 ppm through the past 1900 years, and then a strong rise up to the present. The story of what caused the ice age fluctuations in \(\text{CO}_2\) turns out to be fairly complicated and so we won’t cover that here. But the rise in \(\text{CO}_2\) over the past 200 years or so is far better understood because we have so much more data. 
</p>
    
<p>
Over the past decade humans have been emitting about 38 Gton \(\text{CO}_2\) per year (or about 10 Gton C per year, counting only the carbon atoms and not the oxygen atoms). This is mostly a carbon flux from the solid Earth, from combustion of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, supplemented by the destruction of carbon biomass on land. Our carbon emissions are 100 times larger than the analogous natural carbon flux from the solid Earth to the atmosphere, the degassing of \(\text{CO}_2\) in volcanic gases and deep sea hot spring fluids (about 0.1 Gton C per year). The human-associated emission rate has been growing since the 1800s, with only minor short-term decreases for major crises like the COVID-19 pandemic:

<img src="img/annual-co2-emissions.png" alt="Annual CO2 Emissions" />
</figure>    
    
<p>
Prior to about 1950, the largest source of human-caused \(\text{CO}_2\) emissions came from deforestation and changes in land use (e.g., replacing grasslands with cities). Natural forested landscapes hold far more carbon than agricultural fields or human cities, so the destruction of these landscapes and burning or decomposition of the trees and plants leads to \(\text{CO}_2\) emissions. After about 1950, fossil fuel emissions have increasingly dominated the total human emissions, as we can see in the figure above.
</p>
    
<p>
The atmospheric \(\text{CO}_2\) concentration is rising by about 2 ppm/year on average. This rate of concentration increase represents about 4 Gton C per year. This is less than half the rate of the human emission of \(\text{CO}_2\), about 10 Gton C per year. So where is the rest of the human-emitted carbon going? There are two possibilities: carbon can go into the land biosphere or it can go into the ocean. 
</p>
    
<p>
It is much easier to measure the rate at which fossil fuel \(\text{CO}_2\) is being dissolved in the ocean than it is to measure land uptake. The chemistry of the ocean is smoother, more homogeneous, so that a curtain or ‘transect’ of measurements (from a range of depths along a ship cruise track) can reveal smooth large-scale patterns in temperature, chemical concentrations, and so forth. The land surface, in contrast, is extremely heterogeneous. To measure a trend in the amount of carbon in all the soils on Earth would require an almost unimaginable number of soil carbon measurements; therefore different approaches must be used for estimating land carbon uptake than ocean carbon uptake.
